# discord-multitool

## About:
This is an open source tool written in C# that does a couple things with Discord accounts using System.Net.Http and Discord's API.

## Usage:
You can either download a binary from releases, or you can compile it from the source yourself using Visual Studio 2022.

## Features:
Here are the current features of the tool
- Check Token - Checks if a token is valid
- Nuke Account - Changes the user's bio and pronouns, spams a custom message that you choose in every DM the user has open, then closes the DMs and blocks the users in them



## This was made for fun a while ago. I am not responsible for any malicious activities done with this tool. It's also old, so Discord probably detects it by now.
