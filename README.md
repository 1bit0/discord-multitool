# discord-multitool

## About:
This is an open source tool written in C# that does a couple things with Discord accounts using System.Net.Http and Discord's API. Currently I am still developing this, and I plan to add a lot more in the future.
**The tool is for educational purposes only, and I am not responsible for any damage caused by using this on people's accounts without their consent or anything like that.**

## Usage:
You can either download a binary from releases (it's not obfuscated or anything, feel free to use dnSpy or something like that if you don't trust it for whatever reason), or you can compile it from the source code yourself using Visual Studio 2022 (you need .net desktop development in the visual studio installer). Simply open the pre-built binary or the one you built yourself, and then that's all.

## Features:
Here are the current features of the tool
- Check Token - Checks if a token is valid
- Nuke Account - Changes the account's bio, pronouns, and display name to "FUCKED BY https://github.com/stanmarshvr/discord-multitool" (you can change the code and customize this if you want), then spams a custom message that you choose in every DM the token has.
As I said in the about section, this is still under development and I will be adding a lot more later. Pull requests and issues are welcome.
